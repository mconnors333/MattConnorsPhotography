# Matthew Connors Photography

Matthew Connors Photography is a full stack ruby on rails application that doubles as my Photography portfolio.  A user can visit my site and look over my photos, contact me, or sign up as a client.  A client can view their photos from their photo event.


## Things I still need to accomplish:

* Contact Me functional
* Add packages page
* Create an Admin account for me
* Add photos to portfolio pages
* Image uploader(paperclip or carrierwave) to load many images at once
* Add favoriting/order system for print/photo selections
* Create mailing list
* Advertise
